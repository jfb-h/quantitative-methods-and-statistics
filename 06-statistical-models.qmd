# Theoretical and statistical models

Statistics is about learning from typically incomplete or imperfect data.
Data themselves are not the ultimate goal - they measure (more or less crudely) abstract constructs that play a role in our scientific models of the world, or rather some aspect of it.

So far, we have seen a range of simple visual and numerical methods to describe certain characteristics of a dataset.
While undoubtedly useful, these methods treat only implicitly at least two important aspects of the scientific process which we ultimately want to make more explicit: causality and uncertainty.

Implicit or explicit claims of causality are an inherent feature of scientific theories, while uncertainty is an inherent feature of all scientific production of knowledge from empirical observation.
Statistical models can help in establishing a closer link between scientific models and data by letting us assess the degree to which empirical observations are in line with theoretical expectations.

<!-- ## Causality

- causes of effects, effects of causes (Gelman)

- explanation vs. theory

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

### Experimental and observational research designs

## Uncertainty

The scientific production of knowledge from empirical observation is inherently subject to uncertainty.

### Aleatoric uncertainty

### Epistemic uncertainty

-   Describing and summarizing real-world phenomena

-   Predicting real-world phenomena

-   Identifying causal relationships

# Modeling data-generating processes

Statistical models adapt two important characteristics which scientific models also exhibit: abstraction and assumptions.

-   Abstraction

-   Assumptions


# Stochastic generative models
